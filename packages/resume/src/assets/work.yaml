  summary: This was my first postion in a Technology company after graduating from the University of Strathclyde in 2012. It was a Software Development position focusing on the companies platform at the time - which was called "OaSys". OaSys was a monolithic PHP application which Streams customers used to manage SIM cards and connectivity they purchased from the company.
  highlights:
    - Hit the ground running and made significant numbers of changes to the platform.
    - Implemented the companies first automated deployment system.
    - Worked extensively with other teams in the business to develop internal tools
